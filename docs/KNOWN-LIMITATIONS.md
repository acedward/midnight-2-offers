# Known limitations

- **`up.sh --with` is additive, and `--converge` is how you take a profile back down without a full
  teardown.** Until 2026-08-23 `--with` named the *complete* set of optional profiles, so
  `./up.sh --with offerfiles` on a stack where `evm` was up silently **stopped** the evm services;
  it no longer does. If you have a script that relied on the old behaviour, add `--converge` to
  it. (`down.sh` needs neither: it always passes every fragment, so nothing can be orphaned by
  forgetting to name it.)
- **EVM write path is out of scope.** umbra-evm is exposed read-only: no relayer, no `RELAY_URL`,
  no `eth_sendRawTransaction`. **These endpoints are reserved for a future EVM-wallet / Compact
  signing project** that will connect an EVM wallet through them to sign messages consumed by a
  Compact contract, so the read surface (the two ports, service names, chainId 2400, and the method
  shapes in the source repo's `evm-rpc/METHODS.md`) is treated as a stable contract. `verify.sh`
  asserts `eth_sendRawTransaction` → `-32601` so a write path cannot appear by accident.
- **umbra-evm has no historical state and no EVM execution.** `eth_getStorageAt`, `eth_getProof`,
  `eth_call` into contract code, `eth_simulateV1` and the polling-filter family answer `-32004` by
  design — Midnight contract state is a ledger blob, not an EVM storage trie. A block tag other
  than a height or `latest`-family is accepted syntactically but there is no archival state behind
  it. `eth_getCode` returns a non-empty stub for known contract addresses, not real bytecode.
- **`eth_getBalance` only knows the wallets it is told to watch,** and reports `0x0` (not an
  error) for anything else. Reorgs are not handled either: `eth_getLogs` rows are never marked
  `removed`.
- **The umbra-evm source is commit-pinned.** `UMBRA_REF` defaults to full commit
  `5a46348585ae23994cc408a06f6ef18a78b06273` from `evm-compat`, and
  `/app/.umbra-commit` is verified by the CI provenance gate. The WS bind and `newHeads`
  fixes are merged upstream; this image applies no source patches.
- **Both locally-built images are large**: `celestia` ~860 MB (two Go binaries, 285 MB and 190 MB
  unpacked — there is nothing to trim), `umbra-evm` ~990 MB.
- **The umbra-evm image is large (~1 GB).** It installs UmbraDB's full dev dependency tree because
  `tsx` and the `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-*` packages the wallet monitor imports are all
  devDependencies, and the repo is run as TypeScript rather than built. The upside is that the
  repo's own offline test suites can be run inside the image.
- **Ledger v8 → v9 chains cannot be upgraded in place.** Wiping the node volume means wiping the
  indexer, umbra-evm and Celestia state in the same breath — `./down.sh -v` does exactly that.
- **The Celestia devnet has no peers and says so, loudly.** Its log carries
  `error advertising … failed to find any peer in table` and `Host is not reachable from the
  public network!` on repeat. Both are correct and harmless: it is a one-node network with nothing
  to discover. Ignore them.
- **The Celestia binaries need glibc ≥ 2.38**, so `images/celestia` is built on `debian:trixie`
  rather than the `bookworm-slim` the umbra-evm image uses. On bookworm every invocation dies with
  `libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found` before `main()`, which reads like a corrupt download.
- **The DA RPC's auth token cannot be a compose variable** — it is minted inside the container
  during bootstrap, long after compose evaluates `environment:`/`env_file:` on the host. It is
  handed over as a file on the `celestia-auth` volume; see
  [the auth token section](#the-auth-token-and-how-a-container-gets-it).
- **The proof-server tag `9.0.0-rc.5` is the zkir-v2 build.** Circuits compiled to zkir-v3
  (per-primitive native crypto gates) need the `9.0.0-rc.5_experimental` variant instead; set
  `PROOF_TAG` in `.env` if you hit that.
- **Indexer `4.4.0-rc.3` has no public Docker Hub manifest.** The repository therefore builds the
  official source at full commit `56561b2f5cf5c6839f678257fc69bed1a8b9ba2c`; that release contains
  the upstream standalone SQLite deadlock fix missing from rc1. Compose currently pins
  `platform: linux/amd64`, so Apple Silicon runs this build under emulation and should expect it to
  be the slowest service to build and become healthy.
- **A healthy stack is not immediately transactable.** The node answers RPC and produces blocks
  several seconds before finality moves off genesis, and until it does the toolkit refuses to
  build transactions (`OnlyGenesisFinalized`). `up.sh` waits for finalized height ≥ 1 so this is
  handled, but anything else that transacts right after bring-up needs the same gate.
- **Upstream toolkit bug, worked around here:** `midnight-node-toolkit:2.0.0-rc.4` panics on its
  first chain command against an empty fetch cache
  (`redb_backend.rs … failed to create database: … NotFound`), while still leaving a usable cache
  file behind so the next call succeeds. The scripts prime the cache with a throwaway query
  (`toolkit_warmup`); without that the panic would land on the first funding transaction. Drop
  the workaround when a fixed toolkit ships.
- **`toolkit version` under-reports.** It prints `Ledger: =7.0.3` / `Compactc: 0.31.0` for a
  toolkit that transacts happily against a ledger-v9 chain, so only its `Node:` line is used as a
  compatibility signal.
